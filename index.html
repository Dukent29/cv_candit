				<h1 id="My career">My career</h1>
				<p>I always wanted to work in development but had no idea which development i should be working towards, after finishing my sevondary school(BAC) in 2020 i had the idea to do business tech at university when i was in my home country (Rwanda), so when I came to France I did my own research to see what I can really do at university and then I discovered web development that matched exactly to what I really wanted to do. </p>
